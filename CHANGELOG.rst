Bugfixes
--------

- Refactor RabbitMQ user module to first check the version of the daemon and then, when possible add flags to `rabbitmqctl` so that a machine readable  output is returned. Also, depending on the version, parse the output in correctly. Expands tests accordingly. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/48890)
- rabbitmq lookup plugin - Fix for rabbitmq lookups failing when using pika v1.0.0 and newer.
- rabbitmq_publish - Fix to ensure the module works correctly for pika v1.0.0 and later. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/61960)
