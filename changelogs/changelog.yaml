releases:
  1.0.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Refactor RabbitMQ user module to first check the version of the daemon and
        then, when possible add flags to `rabbitmqctl` so that a machine readable  output
        is returned. Also, depending on the version, parse the output in correctly.
        Expands tests accordingly. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/48890)
      - rabbitmq lookup plugin - Fix for rabbitmq lookups failing when using pika
        v1.0.0 and newer.
      - rabbitmq_publish - Fix to ensure the module works correctly for pika v1.0.0
        and later. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/61960)
      minor_changes:
      - rabbitmq_publish - Support for connecting with SSL certificates.

  1.1.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - rabbitmq_policy - The ``_policy_check`` piece of the policy module (``policy_data``)
        is typically list based on a split of the variable ``policy``. However ``policy``
        in some cases does not contain data. The fix allows ``tags`` to attempt to
        load as json first but in the case of failure, assign ``tags`` without using
        the json loader (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.rabbitmq/pull/28).
