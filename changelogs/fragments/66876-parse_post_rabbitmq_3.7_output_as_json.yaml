bugfixes:
  - Refactor RabbitMQ user module to first check the version of the daemon and then, when possible add flags to `rabbitmqctl` so that a machine readable  output is returned. Also, depending on the version, parse the output in correctly. Expands tests accordingly. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/48890)
